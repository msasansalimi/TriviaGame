I have created a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice) with the timer and players are allowed to choose just one answer per question.

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.
